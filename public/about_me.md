## About Me

I'm **Ron Gissin**, a passionate **Security Software Engineer** specializing in large-scale, cloud-native applications. At **Microsoft**, I've developed pivotal cloud security solutions that protect critical infrastructures worldwide, with achievements like **agentless machine scanning** in **Azure** to enhance security without requiring agents on virtual machines.

With expertise in **Cloud Service Posture Management (CSPM)**, **vulnerability management**, and **server protection**, I design and deploy resilient, high-performance systems. My technical focus includes **Kubernetes**, **serverless runtimes**, and both **batch** and **stream processing** to handle massive data flows and optimize cloud security architecture.

Outside of work, I enjoy playing and composing music, photography, and skiing.
