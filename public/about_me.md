## About Me


I'm **Ron Gissin**, a passionate **Security Software Engineer** with a deep expertise in building large-scale, cloud-native applications. Throughout my career at **Microsoft**, I’ve played a pivotal role in developing cloud security solutions that protect critical infrastructures, ensuring high-performance and scalable systems for enterprises around the world.

---

With extensive experience in **Cloud Service Posture Management (CSPM)**, **vulnerability management**, and **server protection**, I have been at the forefront of Microsoft’s efforts to secure cloud environments. One of my key achievements includes implementing **agentless machine scanning** in **Azure**, a cutting-edge solution that enhances cloud security without requiring agents on virtual machines. This solution significantly improves the security posture for cloud users, delivering seamless protection at scale.

I specialize in designing and deploying **large-scale cloud-native applications**, leveraging technologies like **Kubernetes**, **serverless runtimes**, and a combination of **batch** and **stream processing** tools to handle massive data flows efficiently. My work ensures that distributed systems are highly available, resilient, and optimized for performance, while keeping security at the forefront of the architecture.

In addition to my backend expertise, I have extensive experience with **Kubernetes** for container orchestration, enabling smooth deployment and scaling of microservices in production. I’m well-versed in serverless architectures, ensuring high performance and cost-efficiency for real-time applications. My proficiency in **batch processing** and **stream processing** technologies allows me to build systems that process large volumes of data in real-time, ensuring that the most demanding applications run smoothly in the cloud.

Outside of my work at Microsoft, I developed **Maazin**, a mobile app aimed at simplifying the creation of guard lists for soldiers, which is available on both **[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.armutils.maazin)** and **[iOS](https://apps.apple.com/il/app/maazin/id6475710134)**. This project showcases my ability to tackle real-world problems with technical solutions that benefit everyday users.

---

With a strong foundation in **backend development**, **cloud architecture**, and **security engineering**, I’m always on the lookout for new challenges that push the boundaries of what’s possible. My technical expertise includes **C#**, **TypeScript**, **Python**, and **Dart**, combined with cloud platforms like **Azure**, **AWS**, and **GCP**.
